# GoldmanSachs-Virtual-Experience-Program
Recently, I found an article showing that Goldman Sachs offers a virtual Program Experience for Engineering students
The task of the project was to report our findings on database and password leakage and organization's password policy.
I made my report, learnt type of hashing algorithms used to protect password, level of protection of passwords, hashes, how to crack hashes.
Overall it was a great learning experience, I got to learn more about Cryptography Basics and cracking passwords.
